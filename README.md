# Project Title : 
### Customer Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Network  

## Description
### The Customer Churn Prediction project utilizes Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) implemented in Python, leveraging libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras for model development. The predictive model assesses customer churn based on historical data. The results are then visualized and deployed as a user-friendly web app using the Streamlit library for seamless interaction and presentation.




## Software and Tools Requirements:
1. [Github Account](https://github.com/)
2. [Docker Hub Account](https://hub.docker.com/)
3. [Visual Studio Code IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
4. [Docker Hub Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
5. [Python Interpreter](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
6. [Git CLi](https://git-scm.com/downloads)


## Installation of dependencies and Execution of Customer-Churn-Prediction Web Application :
1. Go to my Github Repository location using this link : [Github Repository by Samarth-Kumar-Samal](https://github.com/Samarth-Kumar-Samal/Customer-Churn-using-ANN) (**Windows**) or https://github.com/Samarth-Kumar-Samal/Customer-Churn-using-ANN (**Linux**)
2. Git clone or download as zip folder the entire repository into your computer using command :
```
git clone https://github.com/Samarth-Kumar-Samal/Customer-Churn-using-ANN.git
```
3. It you have cloned the repository then its ready. If you have downloaded the repository as zip then unzip the repository.
4. With the help of ***linux terminal*** in Linux or ***Command Prompt*** in Windows, open the folder location.
5. Create a ***Python Environment*** inside the folder using the following command :
```
python -m venv venv
``` 
6. After creation, activate the environment created using the command :
***Windows :***
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
***Linux :***
```
venv/Scripts/activate
```
7. After step 6, an environment will be created and we have to install all the dependencies of Python using ***requirements.txt*** file using the following command :
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
8. After successful installation of all the dependencies, to run the web application, execute the following command :
```
streamlit run app.py
```
9. After execution, you will be able to access the web application where you predict the customer churn by entering 19 different input values.
